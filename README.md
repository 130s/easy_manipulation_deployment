### This ROS package provides a modular and easy to deploy manipulation pipeline that integrates perception elements to establish an end-to-end pick and place task
<br>

This package was tested with the [easy_perception_deployment](https://github.com/ros-industrial/easy_perception_deployment) ROS2 package, but any other perception system that provides the same ROS2 message in the right topic can work with this package as well. 

****Note that this package is currently in its Alpha release, therefore some components of this package might be unstable.**
